Near Care with Shout App
============

A React-based version of the Shout resource tool, intended for use as a hybrid app (web, Android, IOS).

##Examples

* Shout Atlanta:
[example](http://shoutapp.org)

##Installation

* Using the following setting steps could avoid computer be full of unknown packages.
    * Install python, pip.
    * Install `virtualenv` by typing `pip install virtualenv`.
    * `cd Current`, create a new virtual Python environment by typing `virtualenv pyenvironment --no-site-packages` where `pyenvironment` is the name of all drivers. You can change to other names. But note, git ignore only contains **`pyenvironment`**.
    * Activate the virtual environment by typing `source pyenvironment/bin/activate`. To quit the current environment type `deactivate` or close current terminal.
    * Install node js virtual environment tool by typing `pip install nodeenv` under the activated virtual Python environment. Otherwise, the node js virtual environment tool will be installed in your system.
    * Similarly, using `nodeenv nodejsenv --node=6.9.0` to set up node js environment.
    * Similarly, using `source nodejsenv/bin/activate` for activation, `deactivate` or closing current terminal to quit environment.
    * Then you can go to `npm update` and `npm start` to start.

* After installation, the project has the following structure:

```
/Current      
   /pyenvironment       
   /node_modules      
   /nodejsenv  
   other files in the original shout  
/Old  
   / files in the previous solution of 6440
```

##How it works

### Data
Shout uses PouchDB's offline-first database library. Data entries are structured into three types, all stored as JSON objects.

1) Resources - These documents store general information about a resource, such as it's address, phone number, description, latitude, longitude, and a list of services.
These documents are rarely modified after they are first created. Users cannot modify these documents as of latest version.
The format of a Resource object ID is :"Resource_" + resource zip code + _ + resource name

2) Tags - These documents store all of the tags associated with a particular resource. They are a separate document, because tags can be frequently updated, downvoted, or upvoted by users.
The format of a Tags object ID is: "tags" + _ + resource name

3) Feedback - Every new feedback (per user, per resource) is stored as a new Feedback object. These are expected to be frequently added by users, but never modified.
The format of a feedback object ID is: "Feedback" + _ + name of resource + _ + current date

Creating ID's like so makes it easier to filter all of the feedback or tags associated with a particular resource purely by selecting documents that have an ID that starts with, for instance, the string "Tags_ExampleClinic" without actually searching the database.

### Search
For search, Shout uses PouchDB quick-search in order to filter data.
