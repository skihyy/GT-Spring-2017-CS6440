- Potential improvement of project Near Care:
  - The search result needs to be more specific based on an updated relational-map sheet the clients given.
    - Add age, gender as filters
    - Prioritize suggested medical provider (based on the order of columns in the mapping sheet)
    - Show the result that only fits the operational time (Hopefully we can get this information directly from the map API that previously team used)
    
  - Add the survey functionality to let user give feedback on their experience after visiting suggested medical provider.
  
  - Provide a visual interface to let user select their symptoms by clicking a human body figure instead of typing.
  
  - Extend the range of “Emergency Service” - other than medical provider, give users option to find information of free food, shelter or behavior helper.
